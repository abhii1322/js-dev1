### Code Style
- Use consistent indentation (2 spaces)

- Use meaningful variable names
- Include comments to explain concepts
- Use `const` for variables that don't change, `let` for those that do
- Avoid using `var`

### Comments
- Write clear, educational comments
- Use English for comments
- Explain *why* something works, not just *what* it does
- Keep comments concise but informative

### File Organization
- Keep related concepts together
- Use descriptive file names
- Follow the existing folder structure
- Don't create unnecessary files

### Examples
- Provide practical, real-world examples
- Start with simple cases, then add complexity
