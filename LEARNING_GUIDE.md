3. **Type Conversion**
   - `js basic/03_conversionOperation.js` - Basic conversions
   - `js basic/04_conversionOperation.js` - Advanced conversions

### Phase 2: Data Structures (Week 2-3)

4. **Arrays**
   - `js basic/Arrays.js` - Array basics and methods
   - `js basic/02_Array.js` - More array operations
   - Practice: slice, splice, push, pop, shift, unshift

5. **Objects**
   - `js basic/16obect.js` - Object literals and properties
   - `js basic/17-object.js` - Object methods
   - `js basic/18-object.js` - Advanced object concepts
   - Learn: dot notation, bracket notation, symbols as keys

### Phase 3: Functions and Scope (Week 3-4)

6. **Functions**
   - `js functions/19-functions.js` - Function basics
   - `js functions/20-function.js` - Parameters and return values
   - `js basic/23-arrow.js` - Arrow functions
   - `js basic/24-iife.js` - Immediately Invoked Function Expressions

7. **Scope**
   - `scopeInJS/21-scope.js` - Understanding scope
   - `scopeInJS/22-scope.js` - Block vs function scope

### Phase 4: Control Flow (Week 4)

8. **Conditional Statements**
   - `control flow in js/26-control flow.js` - if-else statements
   - `control flow in js/26-switch.js` - Switch statements
   - `control flow in js/26_truthy.js` - Truthy and falsy values

### Phase 5: Iterations (Week 5-6)

9. **Loops**
   - `iterations/loops/one.js` - For loops, break, continue
   - `iterations/loops/two.js` - While and do-while loops
   - `iterations/loops/three.js` - For-of loop
   - `iterations/loops/four.js` - For-in loop

10. **Array Methods**
    - `iterations/loops/five.js` - forEach method
    - `iterations/loops/six.js` - Filter method
    - `iterations/seven.js` - Map and method chaining

## üí° Learning Tips

### 1. Active Learning
- **Don't just read** - Type out the code yourself
- **Experiment** - Change values and see what happens
- **Break things** - Intentionally cause errors to understand them
- **Uncomment examples** - Many files have commented code; uncomment to see different behaviors

### 2. Practice Exercises

After each topic, try these exercises:

**Variables:**
- Create a program that swaps two variables
- Store personal information in different variable types

**Strings:**
- Write a function to reverse a string
- Create a simple template for emails using template literals

**Arrays:**
- Create a to-do list using arrays
- Write functions to add, remove, and update items

**Objects:**
- Create an object to represent a book with title, author, pages
- Add methods to the object to display information

**Functions:**
- Write a calculator with functions for +, -, *, /
- Create a function that checks if a number is prime

**Loops:**
- Print multiplication tables
- Find all even numbers in an array
- Calculate sum of array elements

### 3. Debugging Tips
- Use `console.log()` frequently to check values
- Read error messages carefully - they often tell you exactly what's wrong
- Check for typos in variable names and syntax
- Make sure brackets and parentheses match

### 4. Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- ‚ùå Using `var` instead of `let` or `const`
- ‚ùå Forgetting to return values from functions
- ‚ùå Confusing `==` with `===` (always prefer `===`)
- ‚ùå Not understanding scope (where variables are accessible)
- ‚ùå Modifying arrays/objects by reference without realizing it

## üéØ Project Ideas

Once you've completed the basics, try building these projects:

### Beginner Projects
1. **Calculator** - Basic arithmetic operations
2. **Grade Calculator** - Convert scores to letter grades
3. **Palindrome Checker** - Check if a word reads the same backwards
4. **Temperature Converter** - Celsius to Fahrenheit and vice versa

### Intermediate Projects
1. **Todo List Manager** - Add, complete, and remove tasks
2. **Shopping Cart** - Add items, calculate total with tax
3. **Number Guessing Game** - Generate random number and give hints
4. **Simple Quiz App** - Multiple choice questions with scoring

### Advanced Projects
