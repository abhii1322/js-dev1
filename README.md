## 📚 Learning Path

This repository is organized into different topics, progressing from basics to more advanced concepts:

### 1. JavaScript Basics (`js basic/`)
- **Variables & Constants** (`01_variable.js`) - Understanding var, let, and const
- **Data Types** (`02_datatypes.js`, `datatypes.summary.js`) - Primitive and reference types
- **Type Conversion** (`03_conversionOperation.js`, `04_conversionOperation.js`) - Converting between types
- **Strings** (`05string.js`) - String methods and manipulation
- **Numbers & Math** (`06 nums and maths.js`) - Working with numbers and Math object
- **Dates** (`07dates in.js`) - Date object and operations
- **Arrays** (`Arrays.js`, `02_Array.js`) - Array methods and operations
- **Objects** (`16obect.js`, `17-object.js`, `18-object.js`) - Object literals and methods
- **Arrow Functions** (`23-arrow.js`) - Modern function syntax
- **IIFE** (`24-iife.js`) - Immediately Invoked Function Expressions
- **Memory Management** (`memory.js`) - Stack vs Heap memory

### 2. Functions (`js functions/`)
- **Function Basics** (`19-functions.js`) - Function declarations and expressions
- **Advanced Functions** (`20-function.js`) - Parameters, arguments, and return values

### 3. Scope (`scopeInJS/`)
- **Scope Concepts** (`21-scope.js`, `22-scope.js`) - Block scope, function scope, and global scope

### 4. Control Flow (`control flow in js/`)
- **Conditional Statements** (`26-control flow.js`) - if-else statements
- **Switch Statements** (`26-switch.js`) - Switch case syntax
- **Truthy/Falsy** (`26_truthy.js`) - Understanding truthy and falsy values

### 5. Iterations (`iterations/`)
- **For Loops** (`loops/one.js`) - Traditional for loops, break and continue
- **While Loops** (`loops/two.js`) - While and do-while loops
- **For-of & For-in** (`loops/three.js`, `loops/four.js`) - Modern iteration methods
- **forEach** (`loops/five.js`) - Array forEach method
- **Filter** (`loops/six.js`) - Array filtering
- **Map & Chaining** (`seven.js`) - Array map and method chaining

## 🎯 Key Concepts Covered

- ✅ Variable declarations (var, let, const)
- ✅ Data types (primitive and reference)
- ✅ Type conversion and coercion
- ✅ String methods and template literals
- ✅ Number operations and Math object
- ✅ Array methods (forEach, map, filter)
- ✅ Object creation and manipulation
- ✅ Function types (regular, arrow, IIFE)
- ✅ Scope (block, function, global)
- ✅ Control flow (if-else, switch, ternary)
- ✅ Loops (for, while, do-while, for-of, for-in)
- ✅ Memory management (stack vs heap)

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abhii1322/js-dev1.git
   cd js-dev1
   ```

2. Run any JavaScript file:
   ```bash
   node "js basic/01_variable.js"
   ```

3. Explore the code and experiment with modifications!

## 💡 Learning Tips

- Each file focuses on a specific concept
- Comments explain what the code does
- Some code is commented out - uncomment to test different scenarios
- Try modifying values and see what happens
- Use `console.log()` to understand output

## 🔄 Progress Tracking

This is an active learning repository. Files are organized sequentially to build upon previous concepts.

## 📝 Notes

- Code contains learning notes in comments
- Some files have multiple examples for the same concept
- Experimenting with different approaches to understand JavaScript better
